			This server provides a complete implementation of the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">FHIR Specification</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			FHIR is a standard describing data formats and elements (known as "resources") and an application programming interface (API) 
			for exchanging electronic health records (EHR).  
		</p>
		<p>
			This server is built from a number of modules of the
			<a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/">HAPI FHIR</a>
			project, which is a 100% open-source (Apache 2.0 Licensed) Java based
			implementation of the FHIR specification. 
			<a href="http://booklet.atosresearch.eu/content/health-4">ATOS</a>
